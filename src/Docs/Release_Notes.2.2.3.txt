LibUsbDotNet Version History

V2.2.3 (01/30/2010)
====================
  * [Removed] - GetConfiguration call in UsbDevice.Open method. 
    The UsbDevice.Open method requests the usb devices current configuration 
    upon opening. This causes problems in some situations. 

  * [Added] IUsbDevice.ResetDevice method.

  * [Fixed] Bug ID: 2937372 - Read Failed:WaitHandle.WaitOne missing member 
    exception. 
    If .NET 3.5 is not installed, a System.Threading.WaitHandle.WaitOne 
    missing member exception is thrown. LibUsbDotNet should not require the 
    3.5 runtime. It should work with 2.0 and greater. 

  * [Fixed] Bug ID: 2935627 - Stack overflow when reading an ep that does not 
    exists. 
    If an attempt is made to open and transmit to a non-existent endpoint a 
    stack overflow occurs. Expected behavior is to throw an exception. 

  * [Fixed] Bug ID: 2935456 - UsbDevice.KernelType property not set correcty. 
    [Windows Only] If the UsbDevice.KernelType is accessed when no device are 
    connected it does not update properly when a device is connected. 


PREVIOUS VERSIONS
==================

    V2.2.2 (01/19/2010)
    ====================
      * [Fixed] Bug ID: 2934547 - DeviceNotifier not working. 
        On Linux like OSes the DeviceNotifier never fires events. On Windows, 
        a DllNotFound exception is thrown. 

      * [Fixed] Bug ID: 2933530 - Composite WinUSB not found. 
        WinUSB interfaces that are part of a composite device do not appear in 
        the WinUsbRegistry.DeviceList. 


    V2.2.1 (01/13/2010)
    ====================
      * [Fixed] Bug ID: 2930836 - [OSX PPC] GetDescriptor request fails. 
        On big-endian platforms, the descriptor type and index bytes are 
        reversed. 

      * [Fixed] Bug ID: 2927179 - Wrong versioning. LibUsbDotNet 2.2.0 all 
        AssemblyInfo.cs contains [assembly:AssemblyVersion("2.1.0.13")]

      * [Updated] Benchmark application: Removed all calls to Control.Invoke. 
        The benchmark application now uses a timer control to periodically 
        update the display instead of "Invoking" an update everytime data is 
        transferred. This provides a more accurate benchmark reading as well 
        as a work-a-round for Mono .NET runtimes on platforms that do not 
        properly implement the Control.Invoke method. 

      * [Removed] LINUX compiler option. 
        The LINUX compiler option is no longer used. LibUsbDotNet (v2.2.1 and 
        above) is fully platform independent. 


    V2.2.0 (12/29/2009)
    ====================
      * [Added] Linux support. 
        LibUsbDotNet supports linux via the linux libusb v1.x driver. 

      * [Updated] UsbDevice.OpenEndpointReader and UsbDevice.
        OpenEndpointWriter members to first lookup the endpoint descriptor for 
        the current configuration. 
        If an attempt is made to open an endpoint on a unconfigured device 
        (GetConfiguration = 0) an exception is thrown. 
        
        If an attempt is made to open a non-existent or invalid endpoint an 
        exception is thrown. 

      * [Added] endpoint descriptor information to UsbEndpointBase class. 
        A New property, 'EndpointInfo' is available from the UsbEndpointBase 
        class. 

      * [Removed] Depricated UsbGlobals class. 
        The UsbGlobals class has been rendered obsolete and will be removed in 
        future release. Update your code you use the UsbDevice class instead. 


    V2.1.0 (11-02-2009)
    ====================
      * [Fixed] Bug ID: 2886021 - Problem with several instances of the same 
        device (WinUsb) 
        When connecting 2 (or more) identical USB devices, the library has 
        problems opening each device instance. 

      * [Fixed] Bug ID: 2873320Bug ID: 2874172 - Error getting Key 
        "SymbolicName" 
        Some devices having no SymbolicName. In this case, the main 
        application or .NET framework crashes. 

      * [Fixed] Bug ID: 2853283 - Infwizard exception thrown on load 
        The InfWizard throws an exception when loaded. 

      * [Added] support for the genuine libusb-win32 kernel driver. 
        If the LibUsbDotNet native kernel driver is not detected it falls back 
        to the original libusb-win32 kernel driver. Using the native driver is 
        recommended. 

      * [Added] static open method to the LibUsbDevice class. 
        Opens a libUsb device from a user suppiled device filename. 
        
        public static bool Open(string deviceFilename, out LibUsbDevice 
        usbDevice)

      * [Added] static open method to the WinUsbDevice class. 
        Opens a WinUSB device from a user suppiled device path (symbolic link).
        
        
        public static bool Open(string devicePath, out WinUsbDevice usbDevice)

      * [Removed] DeviceInterfaceGuid property from WinUsbDevice class. 
        A DeviceInterfaceGuid is not required for a WinUsbDevice. 

      * [Removed] UsbRegistryInfo property from UsbDevice classes. 
        A UsbRegistry instance is not required for the UsbDevice classes. 

      * [Removed] device and endpoint level locking features. 
        The device and endpoint level locking features had specfic 
        requirements pertaining to the usb symbolic name that could not always 
        be met.

        The GET_INTERFACE request in the libusb kernel driver fails on Windows 
        XP SP3 but works under windows Vista. 

      * [Fixed] Bug ID: 2845679 - InfWizard Spawn driver function problems. 
        The InfWizard spawn driver function fails to locate WinUSB support 
        drivers from the DDK install directory. 

      * [Added] UsbException on non-existent endpoint. 
        If an an attempt is made to open an endpoint that does not exists, a 
        UsbException is thrown. 

      * [Updated] LibUsbDotNet-libusb-win32 kernel driver.
